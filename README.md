# project_a_sales_analytics
Beginner sales analytics project using SQL, Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI
# Sales Performance Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyses sales transaction data to answer key business questions related to revenue, customer behaviour, and product performance.

## Business Questions
- How does revenue trend over time?
- Which products and categories drive the most revenue?
- Who are the top customers and how concentrated is revenue?
- What is the repeat purchase rate?
- How does performance vary by country?

## Tech Stack
- Python (data cleaning and loading)
- PostgreSQL (data storage and analytics)
- SQL (business metrics)
- Power BI (visualisation)


## Key Findings

- Monthly revenue shows seasonality, with a peak in March 2011 and a dip in February.
- Approximately 65.6% of customers made repeat purchases, indicating strong customer retention.
- Revenue is therefore likely driven primarily by returning customers rather than one-off buyers.

## Dashboard

![Sales Analytics Dashboard](dashboard/dashboard_overview.png)

An interactive Power BI dashboard connected directly to a PostgreSQL database.
It allows users to explore sales performance using:
- Date range slicing
- Country-level filtering
- Revenue trends and product-level comparisons

## Architecture

Excel (raw data)
→ Python cleaning script (`src/load_and_clean_data.py`)
→ Clean CSV (`data/online_retail_clean.csv`)
→ PostgreSQL (`online_retail` table)
→ SQL analysis (`sql/`)
→ Power BI dashboard (`dashboard/`)
